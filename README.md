# Personal Website

This portfolio website was created using React.js
Original hosting was done on a personal Raspberry Pi 3 but due to inconsistent uptime, I transferred hosting to Heroku.

The website was coded from scratch and used the particles package.

Background images are all free and taken from Pexels.
